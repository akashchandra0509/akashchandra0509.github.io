Interactive Portfolio Website for Akash Chandra Dasi
This is the repository for the personal portfolio website of Akash Chandra Dasi. It is a single-page application designed to showcase his skills, professional experience, projects, and educational background in a clean, modern, and interactive format.

Description
The portfolio is built as a single, self-contained HTML file. It uses a responsive layout to ensure a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The design is minimalist, focusing on readability and user experience, with smooth scrolling and subtle animations to guide the visitor through the content.

Features
Single-Page Application (SPA): All content is accessible on a single page, providing a fluid and uninterrupted user experience.

Responsive Design: The layout automatically adjusts to fit any screen size, from large desktop monitors to small mobile screens.

Sticky Navigation: A navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the screen, allowing for easy access to all sections of the portfolio.

Active Section Highlighting: The navigation bar dynamically highlights the section currently being viewed by the user.

Interactive Project Modals: Project details are displayed in clean, pop-up modal windows to keep the main layout uncluttered.

Smooth Scrolling & Animations: Implements smooth scrolling for navigation and subtle fade-in animations for a polished and modern feel.

Tech Stack
The project was built using a lean and efficient tech stack:

HTML5: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling and creating a responsive layout.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all interactivity, including the navigation-bar logic, mobile menu, and project modals.
